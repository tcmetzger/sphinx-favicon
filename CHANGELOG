**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/tcmetzger/sphinx-favicon/compare/v1.0...v1.1
# 2023-03-01, Release 1.0

1.0 is the first major release of Sphinx Favicon. It 1.0 brings one **breaking change**:
To better conform with Python standards, the extension module name was changed from
`sphinx-favicon` to `sphinx_favicon`.

If you have used previous version of this extension, you need to update your `conf.py`
file to use `sphinx_favicon` (instead of the old name, `sphinx-favicon`)

Otherwise, your existing configuration should work without any changes.

The 1.0 release contains lots of updates and new features, including
[automatic detection of favicon pixel dimensions]
(https://sphinx-favicon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#sizes-the-image-size),
[basic support for additional favicon formats](https://sphinx-favicon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#name-specific-to-msapp-icons),
and a new, [Sphinx-based documentation site at
https://sphinx-favicon.readthedocs.io](https://sphinx-favicon.readthedocs.io).
